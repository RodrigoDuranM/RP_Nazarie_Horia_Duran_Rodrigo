    #__Description__
        Breakout is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball upwards and break blocks. The objective is to clear all the blocks from the screen without letting the ball fall into the void below the paddle. As the player progresses through levels, the game may increase in difficulty by speeding up the ball or introducing new challenges.

    #__Gameplay__
        · Player Controls: Move the paddle left or right to keep the ball in play. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a life.
        · Objective: Use the paddle to keep the ball bouncing and hit blocks at the top of the screen to destroy them.
        · Points: Each block broken earns points. Try to clear all the blocks to advance to the next level.
        · Lives: The game starts with 3 lives. Losing all lives ends the game.
